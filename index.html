        <h1>EXPLORE & THRIVE WITH AI HOW TO USE AI FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS</h1>
        <h2>How to use AI for business success</h2>
        <p>Our times are, fortunately or unfortunately, about to get very interesting. In this blog we unveil how
            you can win in the upcoming golden dawn of AI!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="AI-adaption">
        <p class="ai-para">Elsewhere in this blog we have discussed that all industries will be "forced" to adapt to AI,
            and why humans cannot compete with AI. It may look all gloom and doom, but in fact, there's much going on
            under the surface, which presents entrepreneurs with opportunities to thrive in the AI-commerce era.</p>
        <h2>Things You Should keep in Mind</h2>
        <div class="boxes">
            <div class="box">
                <h3>AI cannot build personal relationships</h3>
                <p>It can personalize and make someone an addict behind a digital interface (B2C), but wherever trust
                    and people interaction is required (B2B), people will always win.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>AI cannot imagine new opportunities.</h3>
                <p>As I write this in 2023, AI can execute, but not imagine. AI-Commerce era is an era of evolving
                    business needs - you need to be constantly on the lookout for new opportunities. You can be sure
                    that thousands of AI millionaires will be minted in the next 2 decades. You can be one of them. We
                    will be discussing AI Business opportunities in this blog in detail.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>AI cannot own a business or its profits.</h3>
                <p>For now, only humans can lay claim to business profits. So own AI-driven businesses, use AI in the
                    businesses for your advantage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Manage the human element</h3>
                <p>Control your expectations - major disruption will come, and it might feel dire. And nothing might
                    seem to work for you. But you have to manage yourself - see, most startups fail. You will have to
                    have multiple attempts to succeed, and you will need to work hard, be nimble and humble to adapt. AI
                    presents an uncertain new world with threats and opportunities like never before, so you will need
                    to constantly learn, explore and experiment. But as I said above, there would be lots of exceptional
                    opportunities during the next 20 years than ever before in the history of mankind. Use the below
                    <a href="#">Principles of AI Commerce </a>to explore opportunities for you.

            <div class="principle-box-1">
                <h3>AI Commerce = Evolutionary Game</h3>
                <p>This is quite an old video by OpenAI, but it amply shows the evolution of bots by repeating a game.
                    Winning strategies are formed by each side, until the other side learns to counteract them.
                    Please understand that this is the future of AI-driven businesses: Commerce is a multi-player game,
                    and AI Bots are perfect to automate and disrupt them, and turn it into an evolutionary game - by
                    learning using each interaction. Profits become a "score" in this world! They are reflected in bank
                    accounts instead of a scoreboard. This is a video game which has real-world consequences: it is the
                    complete digitization of commerce.</p>

                <h3>Primary Business Activity in AI Commerce = Helping your bot succeed!</h3>
                <p>The key to winning in the era of Automated Commerce / AI-driven business world is to invest time,
                    money and effort in enabling your bots with the right tools to evolve higher and win more. The
                    more your bot evolves, the more "money games" it can win, the more the credits in your bank
                    account.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>You can train your AI only with actual simulations, and interactions with the real world. Data and Time
            are the two critical factors for it to evolve, until it is an acute disadvantage (it is playing with
            very evolved bots, in which case it might cost too much "money" to train the AI)
            Get busy setting yourself up for failure, or get busy helping your Bot to succeed!</p>
